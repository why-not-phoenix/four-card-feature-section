## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a bit challenging, especially, what I am guessing would be the most challenging part for any newbie, changing the 4 sections from column layout to a 2-way layout. I'm curious to see how others went about tackling it. I'm sure there's a better way than the one I used but I am proud of the way I handled it. It made everything seem basic if you put it that way. A simple flexbox in a bigger flexbox.
Asides that, I had issues with responsiveness and scaling which I hope to improve upon.

### Continued development

Responsive Websites
